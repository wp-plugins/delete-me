Allow users with specific WordPress roles to delete themselves from the `Users -> Your Profile` subpanel or anywhere Shortcodes can be used.

== Description ==

Allow users with specific WordPress roles to delete themselves from the `Users -> Your Profile` subpanel or anywhere Shortcodes can be used using the Shortcode `[plugin_delete_me /]`.
Settings for this plugin are found on the `Settings -> Delete Me` subpanel. Multisite and Network Activation supported.

**How it works:**

* A user clicks the delete link, which by default says `Delete Profile`, but can be changed.

* User is asked to confirm they want to delete themselves, [OK] or [Cancel].

* If [OK] the user is deleted along with all their Posts, Links, and (optionally) Comments.

* Deleted user is redirected to the landing page URL, which by default is your homepage, but can be changed.

**Settings available:**

* Select specific WordPress roles (e.g. Subscriber) you want to allow to delete themselves using Delete Me.

* `class` and `style` attributes of the delete link.

* `<a>` tag clickable content of the delete link.

* Javascript confirm text.

* Landing page URL.

* Enable or disable delete link on the `Users -> Your Profile` subpanel.

* Multisite: Delete user from Network if they no longer belong to any other Network Sites after deletion from current Site.

* Delete comments.

* E-mail notification when a user deletes themselves.

== Installation ==

1. Install automatically in WordPress on the `Plugins -> Add New` subpanel or upload the `delete-me` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

2. Activate the plugin on the `Plugins` panel in WordPress.

3. Go to the `Settings -> Delete Me` subpanel. Select the WordPress roles you want to allow to delete themselves using Delete Me and save changes.

4. The delete link will be placed automatically on the `Users -> Your Profile` subpanel for roles you allow, but if you have a Post or Page you'd like the delete link to appear on just copy and paste the Shortcode `[plugin_delete_me /]` there. A custom PHP template can use the Shortcode like so `<?php echo do_shortcode( '[plugin_delete_me /]' ); ?>`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens to Posts, Links, and (optionally) Comments belonging to a deleted user? =

Most Post types and Comments are moved to Trash. Links are always deleted permanently.

= Does this plugin support WordPress Multisite? =

Yes, Network Activation and single Site activation are both supported. Users and their content will only be deleted from the Site they delete themselves from, other Network Sites will be unaffected.

= Is it possible for a user to delete anyone but themselves? =

No, the user deleted is the currently logged in user, period.

= What does the Shortcode display when the user is not logged in or their role is not allowed to delete themselves? =

Nothing when using the self-closing Shortcode tag (i.e. `[plugin_delete_me /]`). However, when the opening and closing Shortcode tags are used (i.e. `[plugin_delete_me]`Content`[/plugin_delete_me]`) the content inside the tags will appear instead of the delete link.

= Where is a user sent after deleting themselves? =

The `Settings -> Delete Me` subpanel lets you enter any URL you'd like to redirect deleted users to, set to homepage by default.

= Is there a confirmation before the user deletes themselves? =

Yes, users must confirm by Javascript dialog box [OK] or [Cancel].

= May I be notified of users who delete themselves and what was deleted? =

Yes. The `Settings -> Delete Me` subpanel has a setting called "E-mail Notification", just check the box and save changes.
